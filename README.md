# React Native Project Quickstart Guide

Welcome to your new project with [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev), initiated through [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Preparing to Start

> **Important Reminder**: Ensure you have followed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide through to the "Creating a new application" step before moving forward.

### Step 1: Launch the Metro Bundler

**Metro**, the JavaScript bundler integral to React Native, needs to be up and running first. Execute the following command from your project's root directory to start Metro:

```bash
# If you're using npm
npm start

# If you're using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Running Your App

With the Metro Bundler operational in its own terminal window, open another terminal from your project's root. Execute the command below to launch your app on either Android or iOS:

#### Android Setup

```bash
# If you're using npm
npm run android

# If you're using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS Setup

```bash
# If you're using npm
npm run ios

# If you're using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Provided your emulator/simulator has been configured correctly, you'll soon see your app live on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

Running your app from Android Studio or Xcode is an alternative method.

### Step 3: Making Changes to Your App

With your app running, it's time to start tweaking:

1. Open `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor and make some changes.
2. **For Android:** Double tap the <kbd>R</kbd> key or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to view your updates.
   
   **For iOS:** Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see the modifications.
